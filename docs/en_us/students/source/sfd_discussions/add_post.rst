Add a Post
***************************

To make sure that other students and the course team can find and respond to
your post, try to select the correct type for your post: either question or
discussion.

* A *question* post raises an issue so that the course staff and community can
  provide answers.

* A *discussion* post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and
  reflections, and inviting community participation.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion).
