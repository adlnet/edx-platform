The list of posts on the **Discussion** page provides visual cues to help you
identify posts that are new, or that have responses or comments that you have
not read yet, and to distinguish them from exchanges that you have already read
completely.

* Posts that you have not read yet have a blue callout image.

* Posts that you have read, but with responses or comments that you have not
  read yet, have a white callout image.
 
* Exchanges that you have read completely have a gray callout image and
  background.

        and callout images

The total number of contributions in the exchange (the post and its responses
and comments) appears in each callout image. To see the number of contributions
that you haven't read yet, move your cursor over the callout image.

       unread 

The color-coded callout images appear when you sort the list of posts **by
recent activity** or **by most activity**. If you sort the list of posts by
most votes instead, the number of votes that the post has received appears in
place of the callouts. See :ref:`Vote for Posts or Responses`.
