Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the same subject that interests you, and then
reading and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps
make the time that everyone spends with the course discussions more productive.
You can search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a
single discussion topic.

.. _Search Discussions:

******************************
Search the Discussions
******************************

To search for text, click **All Discussions** and enter a phrase, a word, or part of
a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When you
press Enter, the search tries to find:

* A match or close match to your text in any post, response, or comment. The
  display updates to show a list of the posts that have a match at any level of
  interaction.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message appears above the posts that have similar text at any interaction
  level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option appears above any posts that have an exact text match at
  any interaction level. Click the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments.

.. _Discussion Topics:

*********************************************
View Discussions about a Specific Topic
*********************************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. Before you add a
post, look through the topics. When you add your post to the most appropriate
topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and respond to it more
easily.

Discussion topics for edX courses can be *course-wide* or *content-specific*.

* *Course-wide* discussion topics cover matters that affect the entire course,
  and may include topics such as "Frequently Asked Questions" and
  "Troubleshooting".

* *Content-specific* discussion topics cover specific video lectures, reading
  assignments, homework problems, or other course content. 

=======================================
View Topics on the Discussion Page
=======================================

On the **Discussion** page, you can view both course-wide and content-specific
discussions. Click **All Discussions** in the upper left corner of the left pane
to see all discussion topics in the course. To see all the discussions in an
individual topic, click the topic name.

Note that course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them, while
content-specific topics are indented under a category name. For content-specific
topics, you can click either the category name to see all the posts in that
category, or you can click an individual topic name.

View Topics in the Body of the Course

Content-specific topics are located in specific units in the course. They typically appear below the content they apply to. 

You can access a content-specific topic by viewing the unit that
contains the topic. To see the discussion, click **Show Discussion**.

You can also use the **Discussion** page to access a discussion in the unit
where the discussion originates. In the list of topics, click the topic that you
want, and then click the name of a post so that the post opens in the right
pane. Then, in the right pane, click the name of the discussion topic below the
text of the post to go to the discussion inside the unit.
