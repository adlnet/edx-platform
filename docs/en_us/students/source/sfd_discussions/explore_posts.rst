Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the same subject that interests you, and then
reading and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps
make the time that everyone spends with the course discussions more productive.
You can search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a
single discussion topic.

.. _Search Discussions:

******************************
Search the Discussions
******************************

To search for text, click **All Discussions** and enter a phrase, a word, or part of
a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When you
press Enter, the search tries to find:

* A match or close match to your text in any post, response, or comment. The
  display updates to show a list of the posts that have a match at any level of
  interaction.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message appears above the posts that have similar text at any interaction
  level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option appears above any posts that have an exact text match at
  any interaction level. Click the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments.

.. _Discussion Topics:

******************************
View Discussions by Topic
******************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. Before you add a
post, look through the topics. When you add your post to the most appropriate
topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and respond to it more
easily.

Discussion topics for edX courses can be *content-specific* or *course-wide*.

* *Content-specific* discussion topics cover specific video lectures, reading
  assignments, homework problems, or other course content. When these discussion
  topics are included in a course, they typically appear below the content they
  apply to.

  You can also access content-specific topics on the **Discussion** page.
  Content-specific topics are indented under an identifying category name.

  If you access a content-specific topic on the **Discussion** page and want to 
  go to the unit in the course where the discussion originates, click the 
  name of the discussion topic below the text of the post.

* *Course-wide* discussion topics cover matters that affect the entire course,
  and may include topics such as "Frequently Asked Questions" and
  "Troubleshooting". To see these topics, click **All Discussions** in the upper
  left corner of the left pane. Course-wide topics do not have other topics
  indented below them.
